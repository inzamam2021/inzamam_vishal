<h2>About us</h2>
<br>

It all started back in 2021 when two NIT kkr students,
 Inzamam ul haque chowdhury and Vishal decided they wanted to make life easier by changing the way India eats - all with 
 just a tap! With their idea of ’hyperlocal food delivery’, all they needed was the tech to power it and were introduced
  to Rahul Jaimini, who brought this vision to life with the first website. And with this, Food Monkey was launched as a food 
  ordering & delivery platform.
In August of 2014, Food Monkey began operations by signing up a few restaurants in Koramangala, Bengaluru. Soon enough, the 
first team of Hunger Saviors came into action to deliver food within 40 minutes. Shortly after, Swiggy raised its first
 round of funding and launched the app in May of 2021. Fun fact: The technology that delivers great food right to your 
 doorstep was completely developed in-house!
With love and support from consumers, Swiggy expanded far and wide, first through the entire city of Bengaluru and then 
across the entire country. As they say, the rest is history.
To ensure and focus on better consumer experience, Swiggy has launched a platform for partners, wherein Swiggy partners 
can order premium packaging material at a reasonable cost and help us in providing an awesome experience for the 
consumers.
